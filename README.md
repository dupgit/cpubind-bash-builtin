This is a bash builtin thanks to [bash-builtins crate](https://docs.rs/bash-builtins/latest/bash_builtins/).

It provides some informations about the cpu affinity and the hostname,
SLURM_JOB_ID, SLURM_PROCID and SLURM_LOCALID if they exists. Optionally
you can provide an identifier that will be printed with all the other
information using `-i` option.

# Usage

Load the library into a bash builtin using with enable, use it and remove it
when you do not need it anymore

```
enable -f target/release/libcpubind_bash_builtin.so cpubind
cpubind
myhostname -  -  -  - cpu affinity: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
cpubind -i "id 1 ðŸ™‚"
myhostname - id 1 ðŸ™‚ -  -  -  - cpu affinity: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

-bash: cpubind: command not found
```
